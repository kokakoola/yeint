  <li>Add Apache Ant to your systems path environment variable, this is not required but makes it easier to issue commands to Ant without having to type the full path for it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to build Plupload</h2>

<p>In the root directory of Plupload where the build.xml file is you can run ant against different targets.</p>

<p><code>ant</code></p>

<p>Will combine, preprocess and minify the Plupload classes into the js directory. It will not build the Silverlight and Flash .xap and .swf files.</p>

<p><code>ant moxiedoc</code></p>

<p>Will generate API Documentation for the project using the Moxiedoc tool. The docs will be generated to the docs/api directory.</p>

<p><code>ant release</code></p>

<p>Will produce release packages. The release packages will be placed in the tmp directory.</p>

<h2>How to build Flash runtime</h2>
<p>The Flash runtime uses a .swf file that can be built using the Flex SDK. This SDK can be downloaded from Adobe. <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/flexdownloads/">http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/flexdownloads/</a></p>
